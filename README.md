# Lucas Kanade Exploration

## Description
This is a Python implementation of the Inverse Compositional Algorithm based on the Lucas-Kanade method. The implementation is designed for image alignment tasks, particularly using affine transformations to align a template image to an input image. It offers a robust approach to iteratively adjust the affine parameters to minimize the difference between the transformed template and the input image, ensuring optimal alignment.


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Add the image you want to match in the folder
3. Run the test.py file
